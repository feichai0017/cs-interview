# 👨‍💻 Interview Prep Daily Log

Welcome to my **daily technical interview preparation log**.  
This repository tracks my consistent efforts to improve across:

- ✅ **LeetCode practice** (problem solving & patterns)
- ✅ **System design** (scalable architectures)
- ✅ **Data structure implementations** (from scratch, in Go/Python/C++)
- ✅ **Algorithm fundamentals & “fundamental knowledge”** (must-know theory)
- ✅ **Mock interviews** (self practice & pair programming)

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each subfolder is named by **date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)**, and contains the content I studied or implemented on that day.
